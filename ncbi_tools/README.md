# NCBI Data Retriever

A user-friendly tool for downloading GenBank and FASTA files from NCBI databases using accession IDs. This tool is designed specifically for students and researchers who may not be familiar with programming.

## üéØ What This Tool Does

This tool automatically downloads DNA/protein sequence files from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) using accession IDs. It can:

- Read accession IDs from multiple file formats (TXT, CSV, Excel, Word)
- Download GenBank format files (detailed sequence information)
- Download FASTA format files (simple sequence format)
- Handle large lists of accession IDs automatically
- Organize downloaded files in batches for easy management

## üìã Prerequisites

Before using this tool, you need:

1. **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your computer
2. **An email address** (required by NCBI for API access)
3. **A list of accession IDs** in one of the supported file formats

- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Mac**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use Homebrew
- **Linux**: Usually pre-installed, or install via package manager

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to the Tool

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the `bio357/ncbi_tools` directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/bio357/ncbi_tools
   ```
   
   **Note**: Replace `/path/to/bio357` with the actual path to your bio357 folder.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Alternative**: Run the installation script:
```bash
python install.py
```

### Step 3: Prepare Your Data

Create a file with your accession IDs. You can use any of these formats:

#### Option A: Text File (.txt)
Create a file called `accession_list.txt` with one accession ID per line:
```
NM_001123456
NM_001234567
XM_001345678
```

#### Option B: CSV File (.csv)
Create a file with accession IDs in a column:
```csv
accession_id
NM_001123456
NM_001234567
XM_001345678
```

#### Option C: Excel File (.xlsx)
Create an Excel file with accession IDs in a column (any column name works).

#### Option D: Word Document (.docx)
Create a Word document with accession IDs (one per line or in a table).

### Step 4: Configure the Tool

1. Open the `config.yaml` file in a text editor
2. Update the following settings:

```yaml
# REQUIRED: Your email address
email: "your.email@university.edu"

# REQUIRED: Path to your input file
# IMPORTANT: Use the FULL PATH to your file!
input_file_path: "/Users/student/Documents/accession_list.txt"

# OPTIONAL: Where to save downloaded files
# IMPORTANT: Use the FULL PATH for best results!
output_path: "/Users/student/Documents/downloads/"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Path Information:**
- **Use FULL PATHS** to avoid confusion about where files are located
- **Mac/Linux**: `/Users/yourname/Documents/yourfile.txt`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\yourname\Documents\yourfile.txt`
- **Relative paths** work if files are in the ncbi_tools folder: `accession_list.txt`

### Step 5: Run the Tool

In your terminal/command prompt, run:

```bash
python ncbi_data_retriever.py
```

The tool will:
- Read your accession IDs
- Download the corresponding GenBank and FASTA files
- Save them in organized batches
- Show progress and any errors

## üìä Understanding the Output

### File Organization

Downloaded files are organized in batches:
- `downloads/batch_1_genbank.genbank` - First batch of GenBank files
- `downloads/batch_1_fasta.fasta` - First batch of FASTA files
- `downloads/batch_2_genbank.genbank` - Second batch of GenBank files
- And so on...

### Verify Your Downloads

After running the tool, verify that both file types were downloaded correctly:

```bash
python verify_downloads.py
```

This verification script will show you:
- How many GenBank and FASTA files were downloaded
- File sizes and locations
- Whether the files are in the correct format
- Any issues with the downloads

### Log File

The tool creates a `ncbi_retriever.log` file that contains:
- Detailed progress information
- Error messages and warnings
- Summary of what was downloaded

## üéì Educational Notes

### What are Accession IDs?

Accession IDs are unique identifiers for biological sequences in NCBI databases:
- **NM_**: mRNA sequences
- **XM_**: Predicted mRNA sequences
- **NP_**: Protein sequences
- **XP_**: Predicted protein sequences
- **NC_**: Complete genomic sequences

### GenBank vs FASTA Format

- **GenBank format**: Contains detailed information including gene annotations, features, and metadata
- **FASTA format**: Simple format with just a header line and the sequence

### Why Use This Tool?

- **Automation**: Download hundreds of sequences automatically
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Compliance**: Follows NCBI's guidelines for API usage
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple input formats

## üî¨ Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for a student project:

1. **Research Phase**: Find accession IDs of interest from NCBI website
2. **Data Collection**: Create a list of accession IDs in Excel or text file
